# 3D-Graphics-Library - *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

## Part 1 - "A SIMPLE TWO-DIMENSIONAL DRAWING SYSTEM"

- Implement **DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithms**
- Implement the algorithm for **rasterizing polygons**
- Implement the Cohen-Sutherland **two-dimensional clipping algorithm**
- Implement the following two-dimensional transformations:
   - **Scaling a polygon with respect to it's centroid**
   - **Translating a polygon by a translation vector**
   - **Rotating a polygon about it's centroid by an arbitrary angle**
